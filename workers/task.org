X = ensures new decision task is scheduled
. = no
- = can only happen when a new decision task is already scheduled
? = unknown, probably no

* Need to know:
** Markers recorded, name, value
** cancel requested?
** which decisions have been made?
** Next id for timer
** Next id for activity
** Next counter for child workflow?
** info about open tasks?

* allow-cancel feature?
* workflow-execution-cancel-requested event handler should be executed last?
